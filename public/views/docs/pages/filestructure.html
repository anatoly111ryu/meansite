<h2>File Structure</h2>

<p class="alert alert-info">From v0.4.0 all the application code has been integrated into a number of packages. Each package uses MVC on the server and client. Below is the overall file structure as well as the package file structure</p>

<h4>Project File Structure</h4>
<p> <p>
<pre>
config
--- env						# Configuration Files
----- all.js                # General configuration for all environments
----- development.js		# Development specific
----- production.js			# Production specific
--- express.js				# Express middleware

packages					# See Below
</pre>

<h4>Server side package code</h4>
<p> <p>
<p>All of the Server side code resides in the <strong>/server</strong> directory.</p>
<span class="label label-info">Server</span>
<pre>
server
--- config						# Configuration Files (see below)
--- controllers                 # Server side logic goes here
--- models						# schema models goes here
--- routes						# rest api endpoints routing - here
--- views						# swig based html rendering - here
</pre>
</section>

<section id="file-structure-client">

<h4>Client side package code</h4>
<p> <p>
<p>All of the Client side code resides in the <strong>/public</strong> directory.</p>
<span class="label label-info">Client</span>
<pre>
server
--- config						# Configuration Files (see below)
--- controllers                 # Client side logic goes here
--- routes						# Angular routes defined here
--- views						# Angular view files found here
--- services					# Angular service files found here
--- directives					# Angular directive files found here
</pre>
</section>


<section id="file-structure-config">

<h4>Configuration files</h4>
<p> <p>
<p>All the configuration code resides in the <strong>/config</strong> directory.  Different environment configurations (testing, development, production) can be defined within the <strong>env</strong> directory.</p>
<span class="label label-info">Server</span>
<pre>
config
--- env						# Configuration Files
----- all.js                # General configuration for all environments
----- development.js		# Development specific
----- production.js			# Production specific
--- express.js				# Express middleware
</pre>


<p class="alert alert-warning">Limit changing code in express.js as it will make upgrading more challenging in the future</p>

</section>

<section id="file-structure-packages">

<h4>Packages code</h4>
<p> <p>
<p>All of the Packages code resides in the <strong>/packages</strong> directory. </p>
	
<p>The package can be thought of as a mini mean project following the same file structure</p>

<p class="alert alert-info">See the packages section for more details about the packages file structure</p>
