<h3 >How It works</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The Browser connects to the desired url which is in the form of http://localhost:3000 (if you're in a development environment) or the site name.
        <br/>The Connection is handled by Express which uses the <a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/consolidate.js/">consolidate.js library</a> to render the server side application markup (the default templating engine is <a href="http://paularmstrong.github.io/swig/">swig</a>).
    </li>
    <li>Page is returned to browser - The page rendered contains the inclusion of the angular.js library(among others). The markup contains an "ng-view" tag which is where the angular app initializes.
    </li>
</ol>
